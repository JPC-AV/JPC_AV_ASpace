# JPC_AV_ASpace

More to come, but for now:

Add ASpace API URL, username, and password to a local file, currently named creds.py (and imported by the authenticate.py file)

Run `python aspace-rename-directory.py` from the context of the directory that has the group of directories in need of renaming.

Update the process for whatever makes the most sense, since right now this is just a proof of concept to illustrate how to search ASpace to get a ref_id and use that value to rename a list of directories.
